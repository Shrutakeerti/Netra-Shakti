# Eye Disease Prediction System

## 📌 Overview
The **Eye Disease Prediction System** is a web-based platform designed to help users detect potential eye diseases using AI-driven image analysis. The system allows users to upload their **inner and outer eye images**, which are then analyzed by a **machine learning model** to predict the presence and type of eye disease.

Additionally, the platform provides a **chatbot** for answering eye disease-related queries and offers the capability to **connect with real-time doctors via video consultation**. Future enhancements will include **recommendations for doctors and hospitals** based on the diagnosed condition.
